# Runtime

A *Runtime* is one live ETAF application: a View mounted into an Emacs buffer, together with the retained tree that keeps its output current, the reactive graph bound to it, its committed revision, and the lifecycle of its Component instances. This chapter defines mounting and unmounting, how to find the Runtime that owns a buffer, how commits and revisions work, the retained boundary for high-frequency Host content and geometry, the introspection interfaces, the transient-space check, and the error condition of the Runtime layer.

The Runtime builds on [Views](views.md), [Components](components.md) and [Reactivity](reactivity.md): `etaf-mount` publishes a normalized View, the Runtime owns the render bindings that keep it current, and each commit is one step of the drain that Reactivity defines. Host kinds, properties and references belong to [Hosts](hosts.md).

## Model

### The Runtime and its buffer

A Runtime belongs to exactly one buffer. `etaf-mount` creates it, publishes the first View into the buffer, and registers it as that buffer's Runtime; mounting again into the same buffer disposes the previous Runtime first, so a buffer never has two. Killing the buffer unmounts the Runtime.

While mounted, the Runtime owns everything its View puts into the buffer: the retained tree and the Ebox node of each Host, the live Component instances with their Scopes, the registered Host references and references to their retained properties, and the buffer-local key handling that [Hosts](hosts.md) describes for `:keys`. Besides mounting a new View into the same buffer, the ways to dispose it are `etaf-unmount` and killing the buffer.

Mounted Runtimes are found one of three ways: from the dynamic context (`etaf-current-runtime`), from the buffer (`etaf-runtime-for-buffer`), or by keeping the object returned when it was mounted. An unmounted Runtime is no longer returned by the lookup functions, but the object itself still answers the accessor functions.

### Output, commits and revisions

The View is a description; the Runtime keeps the output. Static parts of the View are built once, and every dynamic part becomes an effect bound to the piece of the tree it updates. A write to application state queues the effects that read it; the drain runs them in phase order, and between the render and post phases each Runtime whose output changed commits: the buffer is written once, the committed revision advances, and the lifecycle hooks of the commit run. The exact phases, queues and failure rules belong to [Reactivity](reactivity.md#draining).

A Runtime therefore has a *committed revision*, an integer that increases once per commit that changed its buffer. Application code uses it to observe that a publication has reached the buffer, for example after an explicit flush, rather than as a handle on the tree.

## Mounting and unmounting

#### Function: etaf-mount (buffer-or-name view &optional options)

Mount normalized VIEW into BUFFER-OR-NAME and return its buffer.

**Arguments.**

- BUFFER-OR-NAME is a buffer or a buffer name. The buffer is created if it does not exist; the Runtime does not display it.
- VIEW is a normalized View, as [Views](views.md) defines, or a zero-argument function returning one. A function is evaluated with tracking, so a View function that reads a reactive source is re-rendered when the source changes.
- OPTIONS is a plist. The supported keys are `:viewport-width` (in pixels) and `:viewport-height` (in lines), which the first publication uses directly instead of an immediate re-layout, and `:observer`, a one-argument report sink installed before the first render. A nil dimension follows the displaying window. The viewport details belong to the Viewport chapter; the report format belongs to the Observers chapter.

**Semantics.** An existing Runtime mounted in BUFFER-OR-NAME is unmounted first, so the new View replaces the old application. The first publication is one observed operation: the View is lowered and rendered, the whole buffer is written, and the committed revision becomes 1. Registering the Runtime also installs its key handling and its `kill-buffer-hook`, so killing the buffer unmounts it. If the first publication fails, the new Runtime is disposed and the condition propagates; the buffer survives with no Runtime.

**Returns.** BUFFER-OR-NAME as a live buffer.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-runtime-error` when OPTIONS is not a proper plist, when it contains a key outside the three above, when `:viewport-width` or `:viewport-height` is neither nil nor a positive number, or when `:observer` is neither nil nor a function; the data names the message and the offending value or key. A View problem propagates its own condition, such as `etaf-view-error`, `etaf-view-syntax-error`, `etaf-component-call-error` or `etaf-renderer-error`, and the buffer is left without a Runtime. During rendering the call signals `error→ etaf-render-side-effect-error` with data `(mount-runtime)`.

**Example.** A headless host that already knows the layout context avoids the first re-layout.

```elisp
(etaf-mount "*tasks*"
            view
            '(:viewport-width 1200 :viewport-height 48))
```

**See also.** `etaf-unmount`, [Finding a Runtime](#finding-a-runtime), and the Viewport chapter.

### Native application windows

A native text application owns the window it opens in. After `etaf-mount`, display the returned buffer with `(display-buffer-overriding-action '((display-buffer-same-window)))` bound around `pop-to-buffer`, so a user's `display-buffer` rules cannot split the frame into a side pane. Reserve one clear line at the top of the root View: count it as chrome in page and row budgets, and on a short window render fewer content rows rather than clipping the first line. These are conventions of the application, not options of `etaf-mount`.

#### Function: etaf-unmount (&optional runtime)

Unmount RUNTIME, defaulting to the active or `current-buffer` Runtime.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a Runtime, a value the call failed to use as one signals `wrong-type-argument`; omitted or nil, the Runtime making the call is used, then the Runtime of `(current-buffer)`. A mounted Runtime is required: when none is mounted the call signals `etaf-runtime-error`.

**Semantics.** Unmounting is the reverse of mounting: the retained tree and its Ebox nodes are released, Components are disposed and their unmounted hooks run, the buffer-local key handling and the Ebox mount are removed, and the Runtime is delimited from its buffer, so `etaf-runtime-for-buffer` stops returning it and `etaf-runtime-mounted-p` returns nil. The buffer itself survives and keeps the text of the last publication; the Runtime object also survives and still answers the accessor functions, but it can no longer be updated or flushed. Killing the buffer unmounts the Runtime without an explicit call.

**Returns.** RUNTIME.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-runtime-error` with the message `"ETAF runtime is not mounted"` when RUNTIME, the active Runtime and the current buffer's Runtime are all unmounted or absent. During rendering the call signals `error→ etaf-render-side-effect-error` with data `(unmount-runtime)`.

**Example.** Dispose the application of the current buffer.

```elisp
(etaf-unmount (etaf-runtime-for-buffer "*tasks*"))
```

**See also.** `etaf-mount`, `etaf-runtime-for-buffer` and `etaf-runtime-mounted-p`.

## Finding a Runtime

These four functions locate the Runtime an operation should use: the dynamic context inside a callback, the buffer outside one, and the two accessors that answer whether a Runtime object is still mounted.

#### Function: etaf-current-runtime ()

Return the Runtime that owns the current setup, lifecycle, or event callback, or nil outside a Runtime operation.

**Semantics.** During Component setup, a lifecycle hook, an event callback and a render binding of a mounted View, the call returns the Runtime those bindings belong to. Outside such an operation, including inside `etaf-render`, it returns nil. Lifecycle code that needs the mounted buffer must use `(etaf-runtime-buffer (etaf-current-runtime))`: `current-buffer` is the caller's buffer and is not guaranteed to be the mounted target when `etaf-mount` received a name.

**Returns.** A mounted Runtime, or nil.

**Example.** A lifecycle hook opens a resource for the Runtime's own buffer.

```elisp
(etaf-on-mounted
 (lambda ()
   (let ((buffer (etaf-runtime-buffer (etaf-current-runtime))))
     (with-current-buffer buffer (open-resource)))))
```

**See also.** `etaf-runtime-buffer` and [Components](components.md#lifecycle-hooks).

#### Function: etaf-runtime-for-buffer (buffer-or-name)

Return the live Runtime mounted in BUFFER-OR-NAME, or nil.

**Arguments.** BUFFER-OR-NAME is a buffer or a buffer name, as for `get-buffer`.

**Semantics.** The lookup reaches only mounted Runtimes. A name that does not name a buffer, a killed buffer, and a buffer whose Runtime was unmounted all yield nil.

**Returns.** The mounted Runtime, or nil.

#### Function: etaf-runtime-buffer (x)

Access slot "buffer" of Runtime object X.

**Arguments.** X is a Runtime object. Any other value signals `wrong-type-argument` with data `(etaf-runtime X)`.

**Semantics.** The accessor returns the buffer the Runtime publishes into, whether or not the Runtime is still mounted, so it is safe to call on a Runtime being unmounted.

**Returns.** The buffer.

#### Function: etaf-runtime-mounted-p (x)

Access slot "mounted-p" of Runtime object X.

**Arguments.** X is a Runtime object. Any other value signals `wrong-type-argument` with data `(etaf-runtime X)`.

**Semantics.** The value is non-nil while the Runtime is mounted and nil after `etaf-unmount` or after its buffer was killed. Mounting a new View into the same buffer gives a new Runtime; the old object never becomes mounted again.

**Returns.** Non-nil while mounted, nil otherwise.

## Committing and revisions

#### Function: etaf-runtime-flush (&optional runtime)

Settle mounted RUNTIME's pending reactive work and return its revision.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a mounted Runtime; nil or omitted uses the active Runtime, falling back to the Runtime of the current buffer.

**Semantics.** Outside a batch, a drain and a render evaluation, the call runs the pending reactive work now, including the effects a previous failed update left parked, and returns the revision after the resulting commits. Inside `etaf-call-with-batch` or a running commit the pending work stays deferred to that boundary and the current revision is returned without draining. The flush is the explicit way for a synchronous caller to guarantee that its writes have reached the buffer.

**Returns.** The Runtime's committed revision, an integer.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-runtime-error` with the message `"ETAF runtime is not mounted"` when no mounted Runtime can be resolved. The error of the drain that the flush runs is signaled after the drain, as [Reactivity](reactivity.md#recovery) describes; a persistent failure signals again on every flush.

**Example.** A benchmark writes state and waits for the publication before reading the buffer.

```elisp
(let ((runtime (etaf-runtime-for-buffer buffer)))
  (etaf-set-value tasks new-tasks)
  (etaf-runtime-flush runtime))
```

**See also.** `etaf-runtime-revision` and [Atomic commits](#atomic-commits).

#### Function: etaf-runtime-revision (runtime)

Return RUNTIME's committed revision, an integer that increases once for every commit that changed its buffer (ordinary reactive work, Host content or geometry updates, and `etaf-runtime-refit` or `etaf-refit` calls that changed the layout). Tests and benchmarks compare revisions to observe that a change was published.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a Runtime object. Any other value signals `wrong-type-argument` with data `(etaf-runtime RUNTIME)`.

**Semantics.** The revision is monotonic for the life of the Runtime and advances only for a commit that changed the buffer. A write whose observers all compare unchanged does not advance it; a failed update that was rolled back does not advance it; work queued inside an open batch does not advance it until the batch commits. The accessor does not drain and does not require the Runtime to be mounted: after unmount it keeps answering with the last committed value.

**Returns.** The committed revision as an integer.

**See also.** `etaf-runtime-flush` and [Reactivity](reactivity.md#mounted-runtimes).

### Atomic commits

A commit is all-or-nothing for the work of one drain. The drain runs inside a transaction that journals every change to state that existed when it began: the retained segments and Hosts, Component instances, the written values of reactive cells, and the Ebox nodes' properties and text. Objects the transaction created are not journaled; if the commit is abandoned they are released instead. Cleanup of resources that were replaced and are still committed waits until the transaction commits.

When a pre or render effect fails, the Runtime discards the whole uncommitted work: the buffer keeps the output of the last successful commit, the revision does not advance, and the application's own refs keep the values that were written to them. The effects that ran are kept and parked: the next drain that has work, or the next `etaf-runtime-flush`, runs them again. A failure in the post phase does not discard the commit — the buffer is already written and the revision has advanced — and the condition is signaled at the end of the drain together with the other errors. This is the Runtime side of the recovery contract that [Reactivity](reactivity.md#recovery) states.

Because the journal covers only what changed, the cost of a commit is proportional to the state the transaction touched, not to the size of the View.

## Retained Host updates

A mounted Runtime can update an addressed Host's published content or geometry directly, without going through the reactive graph. This is the display boundary for values a caller owns and republishes at a high rate, such as video frames, chart data or live measurements: the value bypasses the Component props and the ordinary publication path, and one Ebox publication updates one Host or several.

#### Function: etaf-runtime-update-host-content (runtime host-ref content)

Replace HOST-REF's published content with CONTENT in mounted RUNTIME.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a mounted Runtime. HOST-REF is a committed Host reference of a Text Host, such as the `:ref` of a `text` Host. CONTENT is a string, published as the Host's text, or an image object as returned by `create-image`, published as one image cell showing that image at its own size.

**Semantics.** The update replaces only the addressed Host and publishes once through Ebox, so a caller whose controlled state changed one value skips an ordinary ETAF publication. Strings retain caller-owned display properties, including image slices; a caller that keeps a fixed-size Host live with per-frame images passes a new image object per update. The View remains the authority: the update changes the Host's published content, not the View or the Component that rendered it, so the retained value must agree with what the View renders, as [Reconciling retained content](#reconciling-retained-content) explains. Use a Text Host for changing media; a Box Host's content is its child structure, and this call refuses it.

**Returns.** t after a committed update.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-runtime-error` before anything changes when RUNTIME is unmounted, when HOST-REF is not a committed Host (message `"Unknown committed Host"`), when CONTENT is neither a string nor an image object (`"Invalid Host content updates"`), or when the addressed Host's retained node cannot hold content, as a Box cannot (message `"Host cannot hold content"`).

**Example.** A video frame on its own Host, once per decoded frame.

```elisp
(etaf-runtime-update-host-content runtime 'video-frame frame-image)
```

**See also.** `etaf-runtime-update-host-contents`, `etaf-runtime-update-host-geometry`, and [Text](text.md) for display properties.

#### Function: etaf-runtime-update-host-contents (runtime updates)

Replace several HOST-REF contents in one retained Ebox publication.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a mounted Runtime. UPDATES is a proper alist whose keys are committed Host references and whose values are replacement strings or image objects, with the same content contract as `etaf-runtime-update-host-content`.

**Semantics.** Every target is validated before the first replacement, so a caller keeping several small contents live — text and frames together — publishes once per change instead of once per node. One call is one publication and advances the revision once.

**Returns.** t after a committed update.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-runtime-error` before anything changes when RUNTIME is unmounted, when UPDATES is not a proper alist of the expected shape (`"Invalid Host content updates"`), when a key is not a committed Host (message `"Unknown committed Host"`), or when a value is neither a string nor an image (`"Invalid Host content updates"`). A target whose node cannot hold content signals `"Host cannot hold content"`; because all targets are resolved before the first replacement, no other Host in the batch has changed at that point.

**Example.** A status line and a preview that change together.

```elisp
(etaf-runtime-update-host-contents
 runtime
 '((status . "connected") (preview . thumbnail)))
```

**See also.** `etaf-runtime-update-host-content`.

#### Function: etaf-runtime-update-host-geometry (runtime host-ref &rest geometry)

Set HOST-REF's position, size or layer properties in mounted RUNTIME.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a mounted Runtime. HOST-REF is a committed Host reference. GEOMETRY is a plist of style properties such as `:left`, `:top`, `:width`, `:height` and `:z-index`.

**Semantics.** Only the Host's relayout boundary is laid out and its changed buffer region rewritten, and the update publishes once through Ebox. This is a display projection of a caller's already-updated controlled state: it does not change Component props and it implements no window policy. As with content, the View remains the authority and the retained value must agree with what the View will render.

**Returns.** t after a committed update.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-runtime-error` when RUNTIME is unmounted, when HOST-REF is not a committed Host (`"Unknown committed Host"`), or when Ebox rejects a property or value (message `"Host geometry update rejected"`, whose data holds the affected references and the underlying condition). A rejected value does not publish a new layout for that update, but it is retained on the Host; [Recovery](#recovery) describes what that means for later updates.

**Example.** Snap a dragged panel to its committed position.

```elisp
(etaf-runtime-update-host-geometry runtime 'panel :left '(px 40) :top '(px 0))
```

**See also.** `etaf-runtime-update-host-geometries` and [Style Properties](style-properties.md) for the accepted values.

#### Function: etaf-runtime-update-host-geometries (runtime updates)

Apply several HOST-REF/GEOMETRY pairs in one retained Ebox publication.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a mounted Runtime. UPDATES is a proper alist whose keys are committed Host references and whose values are geometry plists, with the same property contract as `etaf-runtime-update-host-geometry`.

**Semantics.** All referenced Hosts are resolved before the batch starts and the accepted updates publish as one buffer write, so a caller moving several related Hosts pays one publication. One call advances the revision once.

**Returns.** t after a committed update.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-runtime-error` when RUNTIME is unmounted, when UPDATES is not a proper alist of reference/plist pairs (`"Invalid Host geometry updates"`), when a key is not a committed Host (message `"Unknown committed Host"`, signaled before any host changes), or when Ebox rejects a property or value (message `"Host geometry update rejected"`, with the affected references and the underlying condition). A value rejected in the middle of the batch does not roll back the entries applied before it; [Recovery](#recovery) describes the retained value and the revision.

**Example.** Move a palette and its overlay together.

```elisp
(etaf-runtime-update-host-geometries
 runtime
 '((palette . (:top (px 2) :left (px 4)))
   (overlay . (:z-index 10))))
```

**See also.** `etaf-runtime-update-host-geometry`.

### Reconciling retained content

A retained update is a display value, not application state. The reactive graph, the Component props and the View are unchanged; only the addressed Host's published content or geometry differs from what the View would render. The caller's contract is to keep them consistent: whenever the View publishes that Host again, the View is the authority.

When the Host later re-renders different text or different geometry, the View's values replace the retained ones; a View expression that re-runs without changing its output leaves the retained content in place. A retained update therefore suits values the View does not itself derive — frames, measurements, positions owned by a controller — and a caller that also feeds the value into the View should expect the View's next change to win.

## Introspection

A mounted Runtime can report its committed contributions: which Hosts carry event handlers, what declared properties they committed, how they nest, and which Component instances are alive. All of these read committed state only; none of them publishes, relayouts or drains.

The Host queries see the Hosts that carry at least one non-nil semantic property, such as `:ref`, `:role` or `:keys` — the same Hosts that are registered by reference. A Host with styles only is not registered and does not appear.

#### Function: etaf-runtime-handler-entries (runtime)

Return committed handler contribution entries for RUNTIME.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a Runtime object.

**Semantics.** The result lists the Hosts that committed at least one event handler, in tree order, each entry pairing the Host reference with its handlers as `(KIND . FUNCTION)` pairs in property order. A Host whose `:on-*` values are nil commits no handler and is absent. The list describes the committed contribution, not a subscription: it changes on the next commit that changes handlers.

**Returns.** A list of `(REF (KIND . FUNCTION) ...)` entries.

**Example.** A diagnostic lists which Hosts commit a drag handler.

```elisp
(let ((entry (assq 'canvas (etaf-runtime-handler-entries runtime))))
  (alist-get 'drag (cdr entry)))
```

**See also.** the Events chapter and the Behavior chapter.

#### Function: etaf-runtime-host-props-entries (runtime)

Return committed Host contribution entries for RUNTIME.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a Runtime object.

**Semantics.** The result pairs each registered Host reference with its committed semantic properties, in tree order. The property plist is a copy with the Theme already resolved, exactly as `etaf-runtime-host-props-for` returns it, so a caller can take a snapshot of the whole application's Host contributions in one walk.

**Returns.** A list of `(REF . PROPS)` entries.

**Example.** Dump the committed Host tree for a bug report.

```elisp
(etaf-runtime-host-props-entries runtime)
     ⇒ ((shell :ref shell :role application)
        (title :ref title :role heading :font-weight bold))
```

**See also.** `etaf-runtime-host-props-for`.

#### Function: etaf-runtime-host-props-for (runtime host-ref)

Return committed semantic Host props for HOST-REF in RUNTIME.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a Runtime object. HOST-REF is a reference.

**Semantics.** The plist spine is fresh on every call, while contained values preserve identity and are read-only for the caller. The properties are the ones the Host committed, with Theme tokens already resolved to values; later geometry publication does not replace fields in this copy, because a retained geometry update writes to the Host's published node, not to this record. An unknown reference, a Host without semantic properties and an unmounted Runtime all yield nil.

**Returns.** A property plist, or nil.

**Example.** A command checks whether the pointed Host is disabled.

```elisp
(plist-get (etaf-runtime-host-props-for runtime host-ref) :disabled)
```

**See also.** `etaf-runtime-host-props-entries` and [Hosts](hosts.md#semantic-properties).

#### Function: etaf-runtime-host-ancestries (runtime host-refs)

Return committed semantic ancestries for HOST-REFS in RUNTIME.

**Arguments.** RUNTIME is a Runtime object. HOST-REFS is a list of references; unknown ones are skipped.

**Semantics.** The result is a hash table mapping each found reference to its lineage list, `(REF PARENT-REF ... ROOT-REF)`, nearest first and ending at the root of the registered Host chain. Callers use it for overlapping hit tests: the lookup walks the retained Host parents, so a reference in a slot or a Component projection reports the Host chain it actually committed under.

**Returns.** A hash table from reference to lineage list; missing references are absent.

**Example.** One hit test asks whether one Host encloses another.

```elisp
(let ((table (etaf-runtime-host-ancestries runtime (list outer inner))))
  (memq outer (gethash inner table)))
```

**See also.** [Hosts](hosts.md#host-references).

#### Function: etaf-runtime-instances (x)

Access slot "instances" of Runtime object X.

**Arguments.** X is a Runtime object. Any other value signals `wrong-type-argument` with data `(etaf-runtime X)`.

**Semantics.** The table maps each live Component instance's identity to its instance record and belongs to the Runtime for introspection: a caller can count the live instances or look one up, and every instance is removed from it when the instance is disposed, so an unmounted Runtime's table is empty. The records are opaque to the caller; use them when comparing or counting, not as a source of Component internals.

**Returns.** A hash table of instance identity to instance record.

**Example.** A test asserts that a reconciliation reused both instances.

```elisp
(let ((runtime (etaf-runtime-for-buffer buffer)))
  (hash-table-count (etaf-runtime-instances runtime)))
     ⇒ 2
```

**See also.** [Components](components.md#the-instance-record).

## Transient space

#### Function: etaf-transient-space-borrowed-p (window committed-rows)

Return non-nil when transient UI borrows lines from WINDOW.

**Arguments.** WINDOW is a live window. COMMITTED-ROWS is the body height WINDOW's caller last laid out for, an integer.

**Semantics.** The minibuffer and the echo area keep one body line at rest; while one of them is taller — an active completion session, a wrapped prompt or a message — its extra lines are borrowed from the display windows, which shrink. The call returns non-nil exactly when WINDOW is live, COMMITTED-ROWS is an integer, WINDOW's body is shorter than COMMITTED-ROWS, and the frame's minibuffer window is taller than one line. A caller that laid out for COMMITTED-ROWS can then keep that layout instead of recomputing one for the borrowed height. Growth, a nil commitment, an absent minibuffer and a shorter window with no transient UI are real geometry, so they return nil and the caller follows the window.

**Returns.** Non-nil while transient UI borrows WINDOW's lines, nil otherwise.

**Example.** Fit application layout state to its window in a size-change handler, so a completion popup does not shrink the application.

```elisp
(add-hook 'window-size-change-functions
          (lambda (frame)
            (dolist (window (window-list frame))
              (unless (etaf-transient-space-borrowed-p window layout-rows)
                (fit-layout-to-window window)))))
```

**See also.** the Viewport and Scrolling chapters, whose canvas keeps its committed viewport for the same borrow.

## Semantic details

### The retained tree

A mounted View is one retained tree, and every part of the View that can change on its own is a segment with an effect. There are eight kinds of segment besides the root:

| Kind | Retains |
| --- | --- |
| Host | One Ebox node and its committed properties; the only segment with a node of its own |
| fragment | A group of sibling nodes published as a group |
| expression | A property or text value computed by an expression; re-evaluates when a source it read changes |
| branch | The taken arm of a conditional; switching arms patches children by identity |
| list | A keyed list; rows keep their nodes and move, and a retained key updates its row |
| row | One item of a keyed list, with the item bound for its subtree |
| component | One Component instance with its input cells, Scope and retained output |
| slot | Caller content projected into a Component's View, rendered with the caller's Context and styles |

The kinds and their reconciliation rules are defined with the View syntax in [Views](views.md); this table names them so the commit below can refer to the tree as a whole.

### One commit, step by step

A commit happens between the render and post phases for every Runtime whose buffer output changed:

1. The tree is synchronized from the retained segments: the top-level node — the single root node or a column wrapping several roots — is mounted into the Ebox mount when it changed.
2. The dirty Ebox subtrees are flushed in one batch: styles are recomputed, damaged regions are laid out and the buffer regions are rewritten once.
3. The committed revision advances by one, and the sticky Host mirror is refreshed.
4. The lifecycle hooks of the commit run outside rendering: mounted for the instances that appeared in this commit, updated for the instances that took part in it, and unmounted for the instances that were disposed. Each runs with `etaf-current-runtime` bound to the Runtime and with rendering off, so a hook may write state; hook errors are collected by the drain like other publication work.

The drain then continues with the post phase, and starts over if the post phase wrote state, as [Reactivity](reactivity.md#draining) describes. A commit that fails before step 2 is rolled back as a whole, as [Atomic commits](#atomic-commits) explains.

### Cost

- A commit that only moves nodes pays layout and painting for the damaged region; Ebox keeps the nodes and the buffer write is one batch.
- A retained content or geometry update pays one Ebox publication and one revision increment, independent of the size of the View.
- The introspection functions walk the retained Host tree or the instance table; they allocate fresh lists or plists and publish nothing. Use them for diagnostics and tests, not per frame.
- A rollback pays for the state the failed transaction touched, not for the whole View.

## Errors and recovery

#### Error: etaf-runtime-error

ETAF runtime error.

**Semantics.** The condition is signaled when a Runtime operation cannot be completed: an unresolved Runtime, a malformed mount option, or a retained update that fails before or during publication. Catch this condition with `condition-case`; failed calls do not return a value. The data is a list; its first element is usually a message string, and some messages carry the offending value, reference or underlying condition as further elements.

| Message | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `"ETAF runtime is not mounted"` | A flush, retained update or other operation required a mounted Runtime |
| `"Mount options must be a plist"` | OPTIONS is not a proper plist |
| `"Unknown mount option"` | An option key outside `:viewport-width`, `:viewport-height` and `:observer` |
| `"Invalid :viewport-width"`, `"Invalid :viewport-height"` | A dimension that is neither nil nor a positive number |
| `"Invalid :observer"` | An observer that is neither nil nor a function |
| `"Unknown committed Host"` | A retained update named a reference that is not a committed Host |
| `"Host cannot hold content"` | A content update addressed a Host whose node is not a text node, such as a Box |
| `"Invalid Host content updates"` | UPDATES is not a proper alist of reference-to-string/image entries |
| `"Invalid Host geometry updates"` | UPDATES is not a proper alist of reference-to-plist entries |
| `"Host geometry update rejected"` | Ebox rejected a geometry property or value; the data holds the affected references and the underlying condition |

**See also.** [Reactivity](reactivity.md#errors-and-recovery) for the reactive conditions, [Views](views.md#errors-and-recovery) for `etaf-renderer-error`, and [Atomic commits](#atomic-commits) for what a failed commit leaves in place.

### Recovery

| Failure | What remains |
| --- | --- |
| A mount whose first publication fails | The buffer exists with its previous content and no Runtime; the condition propagates |
| `etaf-unmount` on an unmounted Runtime | The call signals; the buffer and the disposed Runtime are unchanged |
| A flush with a failing effect | The buffer keeps the last commit and the revision does not advance; the failing work stays parked and the flush or the next drain reports the condition again |
| A pre or render effect fails in a commit | The whole uncommitted work is rolled back: the last committed output, the same revision, and refs that keep their written values; the work is retried at the next drain or flush |
| A post effect fails | The commit stays: the buffer shows the new output and the revision advanced; the condition is signaled at the end of the drain |
| A rejected content update | Nothing changes: the targets and values are validated before the first replacement, and the committed buffer keeps its content |
| A rejected geometry value | The update signals and publishes no new layout for the rejected properties, but the rejected value is retained on the Host, so later geometry updates for that Host keep failing until the View re-renders it |
| A retained update whose value the View does not render | The retained value stays until the View renders different text or geometry for that Host; keep the View and the retained value consistent |
| A retained update against an unmounted Runtime | The call signals; the disposed Runtime and the buffer content are unchanged |

The Runtime does not keep a copy of the View to restore from: the View is the authority, and the recovery route for a Host whose retained values have drifted is always to publish the View again — change the state the Host reads, or remount the application.
