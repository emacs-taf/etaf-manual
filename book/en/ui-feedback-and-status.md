# Feedback and Status

The feedback components carry short, semantic messages: a label states a value, a badge or tag marks it, a keycap documents a shortcut, a progress bar measures it, an alert or empty state explains it, and a skeleton reserves its space. They are presentational and stateless — the application owns the value, the visibility and the reaction — and they share one color vocabulary: a semantic variant selects the foreground, background and border the component paints with. [UI Overview](ui-overview.md) defines the catalog's shared contract, [Containers](ui-containers.md) the surfaces these components usually sit on, and [Component Styles and Themes](component-styles-and-themes.md) how the variants resolve through Theme tokens.

## Semantic variants

<!-- index: variant; status colors; neutral; feedback triple -->

A variant names a semantic role rather than a color. The status variants `success`, `warning`, `danger` and `info` map to the `:ui-success-*`, `:ui-warning-*`, `:ui-danger-*` and `:ui-info-*` triples defined in [Component Styles and Themes](component-styles-and-themes.md); `neutral` (the default where a default exists) maps to the base `:ui-fg`, `:ui-bg` and `:ui-border`. A component that paints a variant takes its foreground from the first key, its background from the second and, where it draws a frame or a rule, its border from the third.

Because each key resolves through a deferred token, providing a Theme restyles every variant-carrying component in the subtree without re-rendering. Unknown variant symbols are not rejected by most of these components: they fall back to the neutral triple and become part of the component's class name, which keeps a caller's own variant vocabulary usable through static rules.

## The label component

<!-- index: etaf-label; label variant; text payload -->

#### Component: etaf-label (&key text variant)

Render TEXT in a semantic Label with ordinary Box layout.

**Arguments.** TEXT is a value, ref or computed: nil renders empty, a string keeps its text properties, and any other value uses its printed form. VARIANT is `default`, `muted`, `danger`, `success`, `strong` or `heading`; `strong` and `heading` emphasize the text with weight while keeping the inherited font size. When a color prop is passed to the call it overrides the variant's color, as any Host attribute on a single-root Component does.

**Semantics.** The label is an ordinary Box whose Text child inherits typography and color from it, so layout attributes such as `:width`, `:padding`, `:border` and `:wrap-mode` apply to the Box: `:width 'stretch` follows the containing width and `:wrap-mode 'word` wraps prose. A reactive TEXT or a viewport change reflows through Ebox like any other text. An unknown variant symbol keeps the default foreground and becomes the label's second class name.

**Returns.** A View.

**Example.**

```elisp
(etaf-label :text "Disk almost full" :variant 'danger)
```

**See also.** `etaf-badge`, `:ui-fg`.

## Status marks

<!-- index: badge; tag; keycap; removable tag -->

#### Component: etaf-badge (&key text variant)

Render compact semantic status text using neutral, success, warning, danger or info styling.

**Arguments.** TEXT is the value to display, as for `etaf-label`. VARIANT defaults to `neutral`.

**Semantics.** The badge is a `max-content` box with one column of horizontal padding and bold text, painted with the variant's foreground and background; its role is `status`, so assistive tooling reads it as a status mark rather than as a control. It never grows to fill its container.

**Returns.** A View.

**Example.** `(etaf-badge :text "stale" :variant 'warning)`

**See also.** `etaf-tag`, `etaf-label`.

#### Component: etaf-tag (&key text variant closable on-close)

Render a compact semantic tag; an optional close action remains caller-owned.

**Arguments.** TEXT and VARIANT are as for `etaf-badge`. CLOSABLE non-nil adds a close control. ON-CLOSE is required when CLOSABLE is non-nil and receives no arguments.

**Semantics.** A closable tag shows a ghost `×` button whose accessible name is `"Remove TEXT"`. Pressing it calls ON-CLOSE; the tag does not remove itself, so the caller decides whether the tag remains. The close control and the tag share the variant's colors, so a labelled tag reads as one mark.

**Returns.** A View.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-component-call-error` when CLOSABLE is non-nil and ON-CLOSE is not a function.

**Example.** `(etaf-tag :text "filter: open" :variant 'info :closable t :on-close #'clear-filter)`

#### Component: etaf-kbd (&key keys)

Render a keyboard shortcut as accessible keycaps from a nonempty string list.

**Arguments.** KEYS is a nonempty list of nonempty strings; each entry is one keycap.

**Semantics.** Each key is a bordered, padded box and the group is a `max-content` row with one column between keycaps, so a shortcut such as `C-c C-k` reads as two physical keys.

**Returns.** A View.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-component-call-error` when KEYS is nil, empty, or contains a value that is not a nonempty string.

**Example.** `(etaf-kbd :keys '("C-c" "C-k"))`

## Progress

<!-- index: etaf-progress; determinate progress; track token; reactive value -->

#### Component: etaf-progress (&key value max label variant)

Render a determinate progress bar. VALUE and MAX are numeric (or reactive) with 0 <= VALUE <= MAX and MAX > 0. LABEL is optional.

**Arguments.** VALUE is the current quantity and MAX the full quantity; both accept plain numbers or reactive values and are read on every render. LABEL is an optional caption. VARIANT selects the fill's color from the semantic variants.

**Semantics.** The bar is two rows: a row showing the label and the rounded percentage, then one standard row whose track uses `:ui-progress-track` and whose fill uses the variant's foreground and occupies the percentage of the width. A reactive VALUE or MAX re-renders the bar and rewrites the percentage; because the checks run on every render, live bounds are enforced while the value changes.

**Returns.** A View.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-component-call-error` when MAX is not positive, or when VALUE is not a number between zero and MAX, naming the property and the received value.

**Example.**

```elisp
(etaf-progress :value 25 :max 200 :label "Upload")
```

**See also.** `:ui-progress-track`, `etaf-skeleton`.

## Alerts and empty states

<!-- index: etaf-alert; dismissible alert; etaf-empty; empty state action -->

#### Component: etaf-alert (&key title message variant dismissible on-dismiss)

Render an alert with semantic styling. A dismissible alert invokes ON-DISMISS; the caller decides whether its state remains visible.

**Arguments.** TITLE is an optional string heading; MESSAGE is the body text, wrapped by word. VARIANT defaults to `info`. DISMISSIBLE non-nil adds a ghost `×` control; ON-DISMISS is required then and receives no arguments.

**Semantics.** The alert is a padded flex row with the variant's foreground and background and the `alert` role. The title is strong and the message wraps at word boundaries, so a long message grows the alert vertically instead of widening it. Dismissing calls ON-DISMISS and changes nothing by itself: the caller hides the alert by re-rendering without it.

**Returns.** A View.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-component-call-error` when TITLE is neither a string nor nil, or when DISMISSIBLE is non-nil and ON-DISMISS is not a function.

**Example.**

```elisp
(etaf-alert :title "Heads up" :message "Three targets are stale"
            :variant 'warning :dismissible t :on-dismiss #'hide-alert)
```

#### Component: etaf-empty (&key title description action-label on-action)

Render an empty state with optional action callback.

**Arguments.** TITLE defaults to `"Nothing here"`; DESCRIPTION is an optional supporting line; ACTION-LABEL non-nil adds a button; ON-ACTION is required then and receives no arguments.

**Semantics.** The state is a stretched column, centered on the cross axis, with padding and a row of gap between its parts: a strong title, a muted description and an optional primary button. Empty states are deliberately static — the component does not decide when the state is empty or what the action does.

**Returns.** A View.

**Errors.** `error→ etaf-component-call-error` when ACTION-LABEL is non-nil and ON-ACTION is not a function.

**Example.**

```elisp
(etaf-empty :title "No results" :description "Try another query"
            :action-label "Clear" :on-action #'clear-query)
```

```elisp :figure Badges, an alert and a progress bar
(etaf-view
 (column :width '(ch 44) :item-gap '(lh 1)
   (row :item-gap '(ch 1)
     (etaf-badge :text "已完成" :variant 'success)
     (etaf-badge :text "注意" :variant 'warning))
   (etaf-alert :title "提示" :message "这是一条信息告警" :variant 'info)
   (etaf-progress :value 60 :max 100 :label "进度")))
```

## Metrics

<!-- index: etaf-statistic; metric card -->

#### Component: etaf-statistic (&key label value trend)

Render a compact metric card from caller-owned display values.

**Arguments.** LABEL is the muted caption, VALUE the emphasized figure and TREND an optional success-colored change line. Each accepts a value, ref or computed, like `etaf-label`.

**Semantics.** The result is a three-row column — a muted label, a heading value and a success-trend line — with no surface of its own, because the component deliberately leaves its container spacing and surface to the caller. A nil TREND renders an empty line.

**Returns.** A View.

**Example.**

```elisp
(etaf-statistic :label "Requests" :value "1,204" :trend "+12%")
```

## Placeholders

<!-- index: etaf-skeleton; loading placeholder; placeholder size -->

#### Component: etaf-skeleton (&key width height)

Render a neutral loading placeholder without owning loading state.

**Arguments.** WIDTH defaults to `stretch` and HEIGHT to one standard row; both accept any length value.

**Semantics.** The skeleton is a plain box filled with `:ui-progress-track`, sized by its props. It contains no state and no timer: the application decides when to replace it with real content, and until then it reserves exactly the space the content will take.

**Returns.** A View.

**Example.**

```elisp
(etaf-skeleton :width '(ch 24) :height '(lh 2))
```

**See also.** `etaf-progress`, `:ui-progress-track`.

## The track token

<!-- index: ui-progress-track; progress track; placeholder fill -->

#### Token: :ui-progress-track

The background of a progress track and of a placeholder block.

**Semantics.** `etaf-progress` paints its unfilled track with this color and `etaf-skeleton` fills its whole box with it, so a loading bar and its placeholder read as the same material. The fill of a progress bar uses the variant foreground instead. A component that reads the token supplies a built-in fallback, so both paint without a provided Theme.

## Errors and recovery

- `error→ etaf-component-call-error` reports a violated input contract through `etaf-check-prop`, naming the component, the property, the received value and the expectation: a tag or alert that asks for a close control without a dismiss callback, an empty state with an action label but no callback, a keycap list that is empty or not a list of nonempty strings, and progress bounds that are not positive and ordered.
- The variant-driven components do not validate the variant; an unknown symbol falls back to the neutral triple and joins the class names. The input contract of the value, the labels and the size props is what is checked.
- Nothing is rolled back, because these components own no state: a rejected call leaves the mounted surface as it was, and the caller's own state was never written by the component.
- A progress bar with a reactive VALUE updates in place; if a write makes the bound invalid, the rejected render leaves the bar showing its last valid paint.
