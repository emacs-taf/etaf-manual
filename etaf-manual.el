;;; Commentary:

;; The ETAF Reference Manual documents the core ETAF packages (ecss, ekp,
;; ebox, etaf, etaf-ui and etaf-db) in English and Simplified Chinese.  The
;; chapters live below book/ as Markdown; this package reads them as data so
;; Emacs tools and the site build share one source.
;;
;; Public API
;;
;; Load this package with (require 'etaf-manual) after adding the repository
;; root to load-path.
;; Only the interfaces listed below are supported for use by other packages.
;; All unlisted symbols and implementation features are internal, including
;; names without a double hyphen. Do not require files below lisp/ from consumers.
;; This Commentary is the authoritative export list; docs/manual.md describes
;; the book format and how to build and check the manual.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-manual-language
;; Language code of the manual read by default: "en" or "zh-CN".
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-book (&optional language)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-manual-book "etaf-manual" nil nil)
;; Return the manual in LANGUAGE (default `etaf-manual-language') as a plist.
;;
;; The plist has :language, :title, :parts and :chapters.  Each part is
;; (:id ID :number ROMAN :title STRING :chapters IDS).  :chapters lists every
;; chapter, appendix and index in reading order; each is a plist with :id
;; (a symbol), :kind (`chapter', `appendix' or `index'), :number (an integer
;; for chapters, a letter string for appendices, nil for indices), :title and
;; :definitions, :nodes, :examples and :index lists.  Written chapters also
;; have :part and :file; generated appendices and indices have :generate
;; naming their generator and :content with their Markdown text, parsed with
;; the same rules as a written chapter.  A node is (:level 2-or-3 :title
;; STRING :anchor STRING :line N).  A definition is (:kind KIND :name SYMBOL
;; :signature STRING :anchor STRING :line N :chapter ID :body STRING-OR-NIL),
;; where :body is the entry's Markdown text; consecutive entry headings share
;; one body.  An example is (:id STRING :chapter ID :line N :code STRING).
;; An index term is (:term STRING :line N :anchor STRING).  The result is
;; cached until a source file changes; the sources are checked again at
;; most once per input event and second, so the lookups of one command
;; share one check.  Treat the result as read-only.  Signals
;; `etaf-manual-error' when book/book.json or a chapter is missing or
;; malformed, or LANGUAGE is not provided.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-definition (name &optional kind language)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-manual-definition "etaf-manual" nil nil)
;; Return the definition entry of symbol NAME in LANGUAGE, or nil.
;; KIND restricts the match to one definition kind: `function', `macro',
;; `component' or `style' when NAME has several entries; otherwise the first
;; entry in reading order is returned.  The result has the definition shape
;; described for `etaf-manual-book'.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-example-view (example)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-manual-example-view "etaf-manual" nil nil)
;; Evaluate runnable EXAMPLE from `etaf-manual-book' and return its View.
;;
;; The code is read and evaluated form by form with lexical binding, with
;; etaf and etaf-ui loaded; the value of the last form is returned and must
;; be an ETAF View suitable for `etaf-mount'.  Component definitions in the
;; example may be evaluated again, so an example can be rerun after its
;; previous Runtime was unmounted.  Read and evaluation failures signal
;; `etaf-manual-error' with the example identifier and the original error.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-open (&optional chapter)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-manual-open "etaf-manual" nil t)
;; Open the manual reader in its own buffer and return that buffer.
;; CHAPTER names a chapter identifier to start from, defaulting to the first
;; chapter.  The buffer gets `etaf-manual-reader-mode': `n' and `p' move
;; between sections, `u' goes up one level, `l' and `r' walk the reading
;; history, `[' and `]' change chapter, `/` searches the whole book and
;; `M-n'/`M-p' walk the matches, `g' switches between Chinese and
;; English, `i' opens a jump completion listing chapters, sections,
;; definition entries and index terms, `t' switches the palette and `q'
;; closes the reader.  The mounted page declares these keys as Host `:keys', so they
;; also work when the reader View is embedded and `?' opens the read-only
;; ETAF key help listing them.  Tabs, arrows, RET, M-g and Escape keep the
;; framework behaviours, so controls inside runnable examples stay focusable
;; and operable; activating the run control of an example renders the real
;; ETAF View in place.  A code span in the article whose text names a
;; definition entry is itself a link: RET or a click over it opens that
;; entry.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-close ()
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-manual-close "etaf-manual" nil t)
;; Unmount and kill the manual reader buffer shown in the current buffer.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-lookup (symbol &optional kind)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-manual-lookup "etaf-manual" nil t)
;; Open the manual at the definition entry of SYMBOL.
;; KIND restricts the entry to one definition kind; without it the first
;; entry in reading order is used.  Interactively the symbol at point is
;; used when it has a definition entry; otherwise the command reads a name
;; with completion.  An open reader buffer is reused instead of opening a
;; second one.  A symbol without an entry signals a `user-error'.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-create (&key language theme chapter)
;; Create a headless manual reader session and return it.
;; LANGUAGE defaults to `etaf-manual-language', THEME to the frame's own
;; background mode, and CHAPTER to the manual's first chapter.  The session
;; owns no buffer, so scripts and tests drive the same model the mounted
;; application uses.  The navigation and display functions below take such a
;; session as their first argument.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-state (session)
;; Return a detached snapshot of SESSION's reading state.
;; Keys are `:language', `:theme', `:chapter', `:chapter-title', `:part',
;; `:node' (the zero-based section index, or nil at the chapter top),
;; `:node-title', `:nodes' (section titles in order), `:position' (zero-based
;; chapter index), `:chapters' (chapter count), `:can-back' and
;; `:can-forward'.  The snapshot copies every value, so mutating it never
;; changes the session.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-toc (session)
;; Return SESSION's navigation outline as a list of part plists.
;; Each part has `:number', `:title' and `:chapters'; each chapter has `:id',
;; `:number', `:title', `:kind', `:current' and, for the current chapter,
;; `:nodes' with `:title', `:level', `:anchor', `:index' and `:current'.
;; The shape is data only; the mounted reader renders it as the navigation
;; column.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-goto (session chapter &optional node)
;; Move SESSION to CHAPTER and NODE, recording the previous position.
;; NODE is a zero-based index into the chapter's section nodes, or nil for
;; the chapter top.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-next (session)
;; Move SESSION to the next section, rolling into the next chapter.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-previous (session)
;; Move SESSION to the previous section, rolling into the previous chapter.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-up (session)
;; Move SESSION one level up: a level-3 section to its level-2 parent, and a
;; level-2 section to the chapter top.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-back (session)
;; Return SESSION to the previous reading position.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-forward (session)
;; Move SESSION to the next reading position.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-jump-targets (session)
;; Return SESSION's jump targets as a list of (LABEL . TARGET) pairs.
;; LABEL names the target for completion; TARGET is a plist with `:chapter'
;; and one of `:node' (a zero-based section index), `:definition' (a symbol)
;; or `:anchor' (a section anchor), or only `:chapter' for the chapter
;; itself.  Chapters, their sections, definition entries and index terms all
;; appear in reading order; the mounted reader opens them from `i'.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-search (session query)
;; Search SESSION's book for QUERY and move to the first matching section.
;; Matching ignores case and starts after the reading position, wrapping to
;; the first result when the search reaches the end.  Store the result list
;; for `etaf-manual-reader-search-next' and `-search-previous'.  Return the
;; number of matching sections, or 0 when nothing matches; an empty QUERY
;; signals a `user-error'.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-search-next (session)
;; Move SESSION to its next search result and return that match; signal a
;; `user-error' when no search is active or the last result is current.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-search-previous (session)
;; Move SESSION to its previous search result and return that match; signal
;; a `user-error' when no search is active or the first result is current.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-search-match (session)
;; Return SESSION's current search result as a plist, or nil.
;; The result has `:chapter', `:node' and `:definition', the symbol of the
;; definition entry the match belongs to, or nil.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-set-language (session language)
;; Read SESSION in LANGUAGE, keeping the chapter and the nearest section.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-toggle-theme (session)
;; Switch SESSION between the light and dark palettes; return the new one.
;;
;; Function: etaf-manual-reader-view (session)
;; Return the application View of SESSION.
;; Use it to embed the reader in your own `etaf-mount' call; prefer
;; `etaf-manual-open' to also get a buffer, a keymap and window metrics.
;;
;; Error: etaf-manual-error
;; ETAF manual error
;; Signaled for malformed book sources and failing runnable examples.
